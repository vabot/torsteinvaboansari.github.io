    <h2>My Story</h2>

    <p>
      I grew up in a quiet but closed religious community in southern Norway called <em>Menigheten Samfundet</em> — 
      the fifth of six children, arriving like pearls on a string. My parents were among the more open-minded, 
      giving me just enough space to explore beyond the walls of belief.
    </p>

    <p>
      Studying nanotechnology and quantum mechanics at NTNU shattered the mental cage of dogma. In that international university
      environment, the world cracked open: new cultures, new ideas, new ways of living. I discovered a limitless width of humanity
      through the student culture, and deeper fabrics of reality through quantum mechanics. On the nano-scale, reality itself 
      collapses and reforms — mysterious, poetic, alive. 
    
    </p>
    
    <p>
     As my world expanded, I was drawn into meditation, Eastern philosophy, and a deeper ecological awareness — a recognition of 
      how intimately the inner universe mirrors the outer one. I began to care not just about understanding reality, but about 
      living in alignment with it: caring for people, nature, and the global ecosystem I am part of. That widened consciousness
      led me into entrepreneurship, the discipline of turning vision into form and creating solutions that serve community, humanity 
      and the planet 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Through entrepreneurship, a seed of divine willpower took root. I became obsessed with exploring the limits of the 
      mind, body, and heart, which guided me into the Norwegian Special Forces, where these limits got tested to the edge and crossed,
      again and again and again. 
    </p>

    <p>
      From the stillness of meditation to the fire of the Arctic, from the discipline of the military to the vulnerability 
      of losing a child. Life has carved me open. I’ve met birth and death, love and loss, power and surrender.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, everything I do begins from that intersection,  where determination, knowledge, and wisdom meet.<br />
      <strong>Body. Mind. Spirit.</strong>
