      <h2>Roots in Faith and Nature (1990 - 2010)</h2>
      <!-- You can add a relevant image for this section: e.g.

      <p>
        I grew up in a quiet yet insular Christian sect in southern Norway called Menigheten Samfundet – 
        a community bound by strict faith and tradition. I was the fifth of six children, shaped as much by my 
        family as by Norway’s majestic geography; the vast ocean that surrounds us, and the mountains and fjords 
        that rise like silent teachers. <br><br> 
        
        From an early age, I learned discipline and resilience through contrasts: a 
        father forged from determination; strong, strict, relentlessly intelligent, 
        and a mother whose strength carried a different frequency: warm, wise, steady, and unwavering in her love. Together
        they formed the poles I grew between. And around us, the rugged Norwegian landscape added its own lessons, demanding
        respect, endurance, and humility. <br><br> 
        
        My family was adventurous and curious, encouraging me to explore beyond 
        the narrow walls of dogma. Despite the community’s closed beliefs, those childhood years planted the first 
        seeds of self-reliance and wonder. I sensed there was a wider world beyond our church and that truth might 
        be larger than what I was being told.

      <h2>Science, Philosophy, and the World Beyond (2011 - 2015) </h2>
      <!-- <img src="images/science.jpg" alt="Laboratory or tech work" class="section-photo"> -->
       <p>
  Leaving my hometown for university cracked my world wide open. Studying <strong>nanotechnology and quantum mechanics</strong>
  at NTNU between 2011 and 2015 shattered the mental cage of childhood dogmas. In lecture halls and labs,
  I confronted the hidden fabric of reality – on the nano-scale, particles appeared and vanished in mysterious
  dances, and quantum theory showed a universe far stranger and more poetic than I’d imagined. <br><br> 
         
  Immersed in an international environment, I encountered new cultures, ideas, and ways of living. I also dove into philosophy,
  seeking answers to questions like “How can I know what’s true?” and “What does it mean to exist?” The more
  I learned, the more I realized how many of the “truths” I’d inherited were <strong>not truly my own.</strong> This dawning
  insight ignited a lifelong commitment to <strong>epistemic humility</strong> – a recognition that understanding is never final
  and that I must always stay curious and open to change. 
         
  In 2014 I traveled to San Diego, expanding my perspective even further. Each step beyond my old world made me more 
  determined to <strong>question everything</strong> and to discover my own answers through both intellect and experience.<br><br>

  During this time, I also began exploring <strong>Eastern philosophy and meditation.</strong> I found wisdom in Buddhism, Taoism, and
  other traditions that approached truth not just through logic but through silence, intuition, and direct experience.
  I started to see how intimately the <strong>inner universe mirrors the outer.</strong> The stillness I touched in meditation made me
  more aware of the natural world’s rhythm, and I developed a deeper ecological awareness. I realized that understanding
  reality wasn’t enough – I had to learn to <em>live in alignment with it.</em> I felt a growing responsibility toward people,
  nature, and the global ecosystem I am part of. This widened consciousness led me toward entrepreneurship as the next
  step of my journey.

      <h2>The Entrepreneurial Quest (2015-2017)</h2>
      <!-- <img src="images/special_forces.jpg" alt="Entrepreneurial" class="section-photo"> -->
      <p>
       In 2015, armed with deep scientific and technological savvy, and a head full of ideas, I leapt into the world 
        of startups and innovation. Entrepreneurship became a crash course in turning vision into form. I co-founded projects 
        and joined ventures that aimed to solve real problems – translating my understanding of science and technology into tools and 
        services that could serve the community, humanity, and the planet. <br><br> 
        
        This period (2015–2017) taught me the gritty reality of execution: late nights refining business plans, endless iterations
        of prototypes, pitches to investors, and the resilience needed to ride out uncertainty. Bringing an idea from concept to reality was 
        exhilarating and humbling. I learned how to lead and collaborate, how to fail forward, and how to ground big 
        dreams in practical action. Most importantly, entrepreneurship reinforced a lesson life had been teaching me 
        all along: <strong>the only constant is change</strong>, and to build something real, one must adapt and grow continuously.
        My ventures were more than just companies – they were expressions of my evolving purpose to contribute to 
        the larger whole.

      <h2>Trials of Body and Mind in the Special Forces(2017 - 2020)</h2>
      <!-- <img src="images/special_forces.jpg" alt="Military training" class="section-photo"> -->
      <p>
        With my horizons expanding intellectually and professionally, I felt called to test the limits of my body 
        and spirit as well. A seed of obsession with exploring human potential had been planted in me – I wanted to 
        know how far I could push the boundaries of mind, body, and heart. This drive led me to serve in the 
        Norwegian Special Forces between 2017 and 2020. The military training was intense and unforgiving: 
        parachuting out of military planes into the Arctic cold, long marches with heavy packs in the black night, 
        and scenarios where everything was on the line. Discipline and endurance were not just ideals but daily practices – 
        often the price of survival. <br><br>
        
        In those high-pressure years, I discovered the <strong>depths of willpower</strong> and the power 
        of true camaraderie. My fellow soldiers and I forged bonds in the crucible of adversity, 
        learning to trust each other with our lives. I crossed my physical and mental limits again and 
        again, realizing that they were often more psychological than real. The Special Forces honed in 
        me a resilience that only comes from pushing through fear, pain, and exhaustion. It was a <strong>trial by 
        fire</strong>, and it forged a sharper, stronger version of me.

      <h2>Awakening: The Crucible of Self (2020–2024)</h2>
      <!-- <img src="images/awakening.jpg" alt="Meditation or spiritual symbol" class="section-photo"> -->
      <p>
        The abrupt end of my time in the Special Forces in 2020 was not a voluntary exit but a profound push 
        into the unknown. Disoriented and stripped of my disciplined framework, I realized the System had rejected
        me for the one thing I held sacred: the uncontrollable allegiance to my inner compass. This confusion became 
        the catalyst for an intense, four-year inner and outer expedition.<br><br>
        
        <strong>The Wilderness Years: Surrendered Control</strong> <br>
        
        I plunged into a spiritual and relational wilderness. I explored the spectrum of human experience through 
        intensive therapy (ISTDP), deep medicine work in ceremony, and rigorous study of Tai Chi and Yoga. This period 
        was one of ecstatic discovery and intense discipline, conducted both in the world and within myself:
     </p>
      
        <ul>
         <li>I learned to sense and integrate deep somatic and emotional energy, trading military force for inner flow.</li>
          <li>I traveled from the meditative solitude of a one-month solo Arctic expedition (pulling a 100kg sled, skiing alone) 
            to the collective, expressive freedom of Burn festivals, where I once spent six hours in deep meditation in 
             front of a winter bonfire, seeing parts of my future.</li>
           <li>The high-speed pursuit of truth led me to found Pinecone Leadership, an early expression of synthesizing 
      consciousness and commitment into professional action.</li>
       </ul>
      
      <p>
      These years of accelerated growth, marked by a fractured back that forced stillness and moments of transcendent 
      clarity, were the calibration for what was to come. I was learning the art of growing through both pleasure and pain.<br><br>
        
      <strong>Breaking down: The End of Knowing</strong> <br>
      In June 2022, I met Samina, and our powerful magnetic connection launched a new life defined by love, light, and 
      immediate tragedy. Just six months later, we lost our son, Shams. This singular event shattered the life I had known. 
      It was as if an external force pushed me down, down, down, to break me, truly break me.<br><br>

      My body, mind, and spirit broke down into millions of shattering pieces. This was my true crucible. I felt like a blind man 
      walking in a volcanic field of holes and traps everywhere. My concepts and beliefs of what is and what isn't collapsed. 
      Every time I thought I had endured the worst, it got worse. I felt I did not have any control of my own fate; free will 
      was suspended.<br><br>

      It was from the rock bottom of this chaos, the darkest valley of my life, that the true Awakening began. I learned that I truly 
      do not know anything. I was humbled by life. The only path forward was to stop trying to control the world and to start 
      knitting myself together, piece by piece, slowly, through pure, stubborn presence.

      <h2>Now: Integration and Planetary Change</h2>
      <!-- <img src="images/now.jpg" alt="Torstein now, integrating experiences" class="section-photo"> -->
      <p>
        The years of chaotic transformation reached a point of synthesis in 2024. The birth of our daughter, Alayah, 
        shone a necessary light into the reconstructed life, serving not only as our immense love but also as my 
        unshakeable anchor.<br><br>

        Today, I stand as an integrated self: the rigorous Operator who learned vulnerability, the Nanotechnologist who found 
        the profound poetry in human connection, and the Humbled Father who understands that life's greatest power is 
        its capacity for rebirth.<br><br>
        
      <strong>The Current Focus</strong> <br>
        
       Every project, relationship, and endeavor is now rooted in the hard-won lessons of the past five years. My work is dedicated 
        to building foundations for planetary change, which I approach through three main conduits:
      </p>
     <ul>  
      <li>The Power of Narrative: Using my unique journey; from faith and science to war, grief, and awakening, -– to foster dialogues 
        about consciousness, collective healing, and sovereignty.</li>
     <li>Family and community as Foundation: Committing to the long-term work of presence, grounding the 
        lessons of my chaotic period into the foundation of my family. That also means building new connections in new places to 
        build a sustainable and resilient community for me and my family. </li>
    <li>Building companies: I use my unique knowledge and insights about people and technology to build deep tech companies.</li>
    </ul>
