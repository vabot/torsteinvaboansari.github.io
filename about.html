      <h2>Roots in Faith and Nature</h2>
      <!-- You can add a relevant image for this section: e.g.

      <p>
        I grew up in a quiet yet insular Christian sect in southern Norway called Menigheten Samfundet – 
        a community bound by strict faith and tradition. I was the fifth of six children, shaped as much by my 
        family as by Norway’s majestic geography; the vast ocean that surrounds us, and the mountains and fjords 
        that rise like silent teachers. From an early age, I learned discipline and resilience through contrasts: a 
        father forged from determination; strong, strict, relentlessly intelligent, 
        and a mother whose strength carried a different frequency: warm, wise, steady, and unwavering in her love. Together
        they formed the poles I grew between. And around us, the rugged Norwegian landscape added its own lessons, demanding
        respect, endurance, and humility. My family was adventurous and curious, encouraging me to explore beyond 
        the narrow walls of dogma. Despite the community’s closed beliefs, those childhood years planted the first 
        seeds of self-reliance and wonder. I sensed there was a wider world beyond our church and that truth might 
        be larger than what I was being told.

      <h2>Science, Philosophy, and the World Beyond</h2>
      <!-- <img src="images/science.jpg" alt="Laboratory or tech work" class="section-photo"> -->
       <p>
  Leaving my hometown for university cracked my world wide open. Studying <strong>nanotechnology and quantum mechanics</strong>
  at NTNU between 2011 and 2015 shattered the mental cage of childhood dogmas. In lecture halls and labs,
  I confronted the hidden fabric of reality – on the nano-scale, particles appeared and vanished in mysterious
  dances, and quantum theory showed a universe far stranger and more poetic than I’d imagined. Immersed in an
  international environment, I encountered new cultures, ideas, and ways of living. I also dove into philosophy,
  seeking answers to questions like “How can I know what’s true?” and “What does it mean to exist?” The more
  I learned, the more I realized how many of the “truths” I’d inherited were <strong>not truly my own.</strong> This dawning
  insight ignited a lifelong commitment to <strong>epistemic humility</strong> – a recognition that understanding is never final
  and that I must always stay curious and open to change. In 2014 I traveled to San Diego, expanding my perspective
  even further. Each step beyond my old world made me more determined to <strong>question everything</strong> and to discover my own
  answers through both intellect and experience.<br><br>

  During this time, I also began exploring <strong>Eastern philosophy and meditation.</strong> I found wisdom in Buddhism, Taoism, and
  other traditions that approached truth not just through logic but through silence, intuition, and direct experience.
  I started to see how intimately the <strong>inner universe mirrors the outer.</strong> The stillness I touched in meditation made me
  more aware of the natural world’s rhythm, and I developed a deeper ecological awareness. I realized that understanding
  reality wasn’t enough – I had to learn to <em>live in alignment with it.</em> I felt a growing responsibility toward people,
  nature, and the global ecosystem I am part of. This widened consciousness led me toward entrepreneurship as the next
  step of my journey.

      <h2>The Entrepreneurial Quest</h2>
      <!-- <img src="images/special_forces.jpg" alt="Entrepreneurial" class="section-photo"> -->
      <p>
       In 2015, armed with deep scientific and technological savvy, and a head full of ideas, I leapt into the world 
        of startups and innovation. 
        Entrepreneurship became a crash course in turning vision into form. I co-founded projects and joined ventures 
        that aimed to solve real problems – translating my understanding of science and technology into tools and 
        services that could serve the community, humanity, and the planet. This period (2015–2017) taught me the 
        gritty reality of execution: late nights refining business plans, endless iterations of prototypes, pitches to
        investors, and the resilience needed to ride out uncertainty. Bringing an idea from concept to reality was 
        exhilarating and humbling. I learned how to lead and collaborate, how to fail forward, and how to ground big 
        dreams in practical action. Most importantly, entrepreneurship reinforced a lesson life had been teaching me 
        all along: <strong>the only constant is change</strong>, and to build something real, one must adapt and grow continuously.
        My ventures were more than just companies – they were expressions of my evolving purpose to contribute to 
        the larger whole.

      <h2>Trials of Body and Mind in the Special Forces</h2>
      <!-- <img src="images/special_forces.jpg" alt="Military training" class="section-photo"> -->
      <p>
        With my horizons expanding intellectually and professionally, I felt called to test the limits of my body 
        and spirit as well. A seed of obsession with exploring human potential had been planted in me – I wanted to 
        know how far I could push the boundaries of mind, body, and heart. This drive led me to serve in the 
        Norwegian Special Forces between 2017 and 2020. The military training was intense and unforgiving: 
        parachuting out of military planes into the Arctic cold, long marches with heavy packs in the black night, 
        and scenarios where everything was on the line. Discipline and endurance were not just ideals but daily practices – 
        often the price of survival. In those high-pressure years, I discovered the <strong>depths of willpower</strong> and the power 
        of true camaraderie. My fellow soldiers and I forged bonds in the crucible of adversity, 
        learning to trust each other with our lives. I crossed my physical and mental limits again and 
        again, realizing that they were often more psychological than real. The Special Forces honed in 
        me a resilience that only comes from pushing through fear, pain, and exhaustion. It was a <strong>trial by 
        fire</strong>, and it forged a sharper, stronger version of me. Life still had deeper tests in store.

      <h2>Breaking Open: Loss, Healing, and Spiritual Awakening</h2>
      <!-- <img src="images/awakening.jpg" alt="Meditation or spiritual symbol" class="section-photo"> -->
      <p>
        Yet for all the external challenges, life’s deepest trials were personal. 
        The loss of my son shattered the world I knew and set me on a path of inner healing and transformation. 
        I turned to spiritual work; long meditation retreats, heart-centered practices, and learnt the deep wisdom of 
        yoga, shamanism, Taoism, eventually discovering a deeper place within, where everything originates. 
        Through surrender and self-inquiry, I experienced a profound awakening that changed how I view life and purpose.

      <h2>Now</h2>
      <!-- <img src="images/now.jpg" alt="Torstein now, integrating experiences" class="section-photo"> -->
      <p>
        Today, I integrate all these threads — science and spirituality, discipline and compassion, vulnerability and raw power, 
        curiosity and adaptation, into what I’m building. I'm focused on projects and communities that build resilience and appreciate
        freedom that both foster growth and respect and honor death, and that are insanely ambitious, crazy and limitless in their faith
        in what is possible. Whether it's reconnecting people with their true nature or developing new technologies, everything I work 
        on is about building foundations for the new era of life on Earth.
