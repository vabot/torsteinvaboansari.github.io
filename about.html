      <h2>Roots</h2>
      <!-- You can add a relevant image for this section: e.g. <img src="images/roots.jpg" alt="Norwegian mountains" class="section-photo"> -->
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Norway, cradled by its mountains and fjords. 
        Early on, I learned the values of discipline and resilience from my family and the rugged landscape around me. 
        Those roots instilled in me a deep respect for nature and a drive to push my own limits.

      <h2>Science &amp; Technology</h2>
      <!-- <img src="images/science.jpg" alt="Laboratory or tech work" class="section-photo"> -->
      <p>
        My quest for understanding led me into the world of science and technology. 
        I delved into nanotechnology and quantum mechanics, fields that challenged me to think at both the smallest and the grandest scales. 
        That scientific journey eventually sparked my path in entrepreneurship — learning to turn theoretical ideas into real-world solutions.

      <h2>Discipline &amp; Depth</h2>
      <!-- <img src="images/special_forces.jpg" alt="Military training" class="section-photo"> -->
      <p>
        I also sought tests of body and spirit. I served in the special forces, where discipline and endurance were a daily practice and survival was a very real challenge. 
        In those high-pressure years, I discovered the depths of human willpower, focus, and the power of true camaraderie.

      <h2>Awakening</h2>
      <!-- <img src="images/awakening.jpg" alt="Meditation or spiritual symbol" class="section-photo"> -->
      <p>
        Yet for all the external challenges, life’s deepest trials were personal. 
        The loss of my son shattered the world I knew and set me on a path of inner healing and transformation. 
        I turned to spiritual work — long meditation retreats, heart-centered practices, and explorations like the Gene Keys — seeking understanding in the face of grief. 
        Through surrender and self-inquiry, I experienced a profound awakening that changed how I view life and purpose.

      <h2>Now</h2>
      <!-- <img src="images/now.jpg" alt="Torstein now, integrating experiences" class="section-photo"> -->
      <p>
        Today, I strive to integrate all these threads — science and spirituality, discipline and compassion — into what I’m building. 
        I'm focused on projects and communities that foster growth, resilience, and freedom for others. 
        Whether it's reconnecting people with nature or developing new technologies, everything I work on is about sharing what I've learned on my journey to help others on theirs.
